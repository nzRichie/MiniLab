# first thread stack past that limit fails to lock and ovs-vswitchd dies with
# "pthread_create failed (Resource temporarily unavailable)". Locking buys this
# lab nothing: a lab switch forwards a handful of packets and never needs its
# pages pinned. Under rootful Docker the resulting datapath is identical.

# Privileged host networking, performed from a helper container.
#
# Wiring a lab needs privileges a learner's account will not have: CAP_NET_ADMIN
# to create a veth pair, and CAP_SYS_ADMIN to enter a container's network
# namespace and rename the interface inside it. Rather than require root on the
# host, a throwaway --privileged container holds them.
#
# The helper keeps a network namespace of its own (--network=none). Both ends of
# every veth pair are moved out into lab containers, so the namespace the pair is
# created in never matters. Asking for the host's namespace (--network=host)
# only breaks the helper under a rootless daemon, where that namespace belongs to
# a user namespace the helper holds no privilege in and every `ip link add`
# returns EPERM. --pid=host stays: it is what makes each lab container's
# /proc/<pid>/ns/net reachable for the moves.
#
# Renames run through `nsenter --net`, not `ip netns exec`. iproute2 remounts
# /sys on every namespace switch and a user namespace forbids that, while the
# rename itself is pure netlink and needs no sysfs at all.
#
# The kernel objects are identical to the host-root path: same veth pair, same
# namespaces, same interface names, same OVS ports. Only the identity of the
# process issuing the netlink calls changes, which nothing in the data plane can
# observe. Docker access is the only privilege a learner needs, and on a rootless
# daemon that access no longer carries root on the host.
